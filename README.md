6-Week AI App Mastery Workshop

A hands-on program combining technical implementation with product management best practices to build enterprise-ready AI applications with RAG, prompt engineering, and multi-agent systems.

🚀 About This Repository 

This repository contains the curriculum, code samples, and project materials for the 6-Week AI App Mastery Workshop. As you progress through building a multi-agent knowledge assistant, you'll learn to balance technical implementation with product thinking at every step.


🎯 Final Project: Multi-Agent Knowledge Assistant

By the end of the workshop, you'll build a comprehensive multi-agent system that includes:

Build a multi-agent knowledge assistant that combines:
- ✅ Retrieval Agent (metadata-aware RAG for enterprise docs)
- ✅ Summarization Agent (executive briefs)
- ✅ Classification/Routing Agent (routes queries to the right system or team)

- Week 3: Summarization & Synthesis with Claude

PM Focus: Use case definition, quality checklist, model selection


- Week 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration & Classification

PM Focus: Assistant scope boundaries, handoff experiences, flow transparency


- Week 5: Evaluation, Testing & Iterative Refinement

PM Focus: Metrics definition, UAT planning, compliance handling


- Week 6: Capstone – Multi-Agent Assistant Integration

PM Focus: Launch planning, stakeholder presentation, roadmap development
